# Predicting Bank Insolvencies: A Data-Driven Approach

### Overview
This project predicts bank insolvency using key financial indicators. Machine learning models—Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost—were applied, achieving an 86% accuracy rate. The original dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was cleaned and enriched for reliable predictions.

### Files
- **`bank.csv`**: Original dataset.
- **`final_data.csv`**: Processed dataset after cleaning.
- **`Bankruptcy_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with all steps—data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.
